        <p>
            I am a graduate from the University of California: San Diego with a 
            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I served in the U.S. Army 
            from 2013 through 2016, in which I was honorably discharged.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a civilian, I hope I can continue to serve my community by developing 
            applications and solving complex problems, keeping stakeholders in mind
            throughout the entire development process. I am genuinly excited to continue
            thriving in my career, growing as a professional and establishing myself as a 
            trustworthy colleague.
